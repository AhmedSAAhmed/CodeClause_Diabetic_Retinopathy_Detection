# CodeClause_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection

Diabetic Retinopathy In this kernel we wil use Convolutional Neural Networks to predict the probability that wether a person is suffering from DIabteic Retinopathy or not using the sample images provided to us in the dataset.

Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems.![diabetic-rethonopaty-1200x675](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91282437/196446204-e9bed300-98dc-4b52-a0e9-322b58550733.jpg)
You might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. As the condition progresses, diabetic retinopathy symptoms may include:

* Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)
* Blurred vision
* Fluctuating vision
* Impaired color vision
* Dark or empty areas in your vision
* Vision loss
* Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes.

**Diabetic retinopathy can lead to other serious eye conditions:** 

1. Diabetic macular edema (DME). Over time, about half of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DME. DME happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid, causing swelling in the macula (a part of the retina). If you have DME, your vision will become blurry because of the extra fluid in your macula.  

2. Neovascular glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathy can cause abnormal blood vessels to grow out of the retina and block fluid from draining out of the eye. This causes a type of glaucoma.

Diabetic retinopathy is caused by high blood sugar due to diabetes. Over time, having too much sugar in your blood can damage your retina — the part of your eye that detects light and sends signals to your brain through a nerve in the back of your eye (optic nerve).  



Diabetes damages blood vessels all over the body. The damage to your eyes starts when sugar blocks the tiny blood vessels that go to your retina, causing them to leak fluid or bleed. To make up for these blocked blood vessels, your eyes then grow new blood vessels that don’t work well. These new blood vessels can leak or bleed easily.
